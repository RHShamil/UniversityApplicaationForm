# UniversityApplicaationForm

We have created a simple application form of a university using Jframe and Mysql Database.
Applicants can put information and apply for the admission, all those information will be directly go to the database. If an applicant do not fill all the sector, they canâ€™t apply.

Unfortunately I don't have the code file and the jframe creates code as we design the form. You just have to edit the action listener. I am attaching the PDF report file of the project. You can check the design, flow diagram and action listener code from the PDF.
